# Project: Performing and Analyzing a Network Attack - Slowloris DDoS on Metasploitable

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview
This project focuses on understanding and analyzing a Slowloris Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The attack will be simulated using `slowloris.pl` targeting a Metasploitable environment. The objective is to explore both theoretical aspects and practical execution, assess its impact, and recommend defense mechanisms.

### 1.2. Objectives
- To understand the mechanisms and impact of Slowloris DDoS attacks.
- To execute a Slowloris attack on a Metasploitable virtual machine and analyze its effects.
- To evaluate existing defense strategies and provide recommendations for improvement.

## 2. Theoretical Analysis

### 2.1. Attack Definition
- **Type of Attack:** Slowloris DDoS
- **Description:** Slowloris is a type of DDoS attack that targets web servers by opening connections and keeping them open, consuming server resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing the server.

### 2.2. Mechanism
- **Technical Details:** Slowloris works by initiating numerous connections to the target web server and sending incomplete HTTP requests. The server keeps these connections open, eventually exhausting its connection pool and becoming unresponsive to new requests.
- **Steps Involved:**
  1. **Initiate Connections:** Slowloris opens multiple connections to the target server.
  2. **Send Incomplete Requests:** Send headers to the server and keep them open without completing the requests.
  3. **Exhaust Resources:** The server’s connection pool is filled with these incomplete requests, leading to service disruption.

### 2.3. Historical Examples
- **Case Study 1:** **Slowloris Attack on a Web Server**
  - The Slowloris attack has been used against various web servers to demonstrate its ability to cause denial of service by leveraging incomplete HTTP requests.
- **Case Study 2:** **Public Demonstrations**
  - Slowloris has been used in security demonstrations to show how easily a web server’s resources can be overwhelmed with minimal bandwidth.

### 2.4. Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** Slowloris can significantly degrade the performance of the targeted web server, leading to service outages and loss of availability for legitimate users.
- **Typical Targets:**
  - **Web Servers:** Particularly those with limited connection handling capabilities or lack of proper security configurations.

### 2.5. Defense Mechanisms
- **Prevention Strategies:**
  - **Timeouts:** Implement connection timeouts to close idle connections after a certain period.
  - **Connection Limits:** Configure server limits to handle a manageable number of simultaneous connections.
- **Detection Techniques:**
  - **Traffic Monitoring:** Monitor for abnormal patterns in connection requests and durations.
  - **Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limits on incoming connections to mitigate the impact.
- **Mitigation Methods:**
  - **Load Balancers:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic and mitigate the effects of Slowloris attacks.
  - **WAFs (Web Application Firewalls):** Implement WAFs to detect and block suspicious requests.

## 3. Practical Execution

### 3.1. Setup
- **Environment:** 
  - **Metasploitable:** A vulnerable virtual machine configured as the target for the attack.

  - **Attacking Machine:** A separate machine configured to run `slowloris.pl`.
![2](C:\Users\SIDDHARTH\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Extion_Internship\PIC\slowloris_command.png)
- **Tools:**
  - **slowloris.pl:** A Perl script used to perform the Slowloris attack.
  - **Wireshark:** For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
  - **Netstat:** For monitoring active connections on the Metasploitable VM.

### 3.2. Execution
- **Simulation Steps:**
  1. **Prepare Metasploitable:** Ensure Metasploitable is running and accessible.
  2. **Deploy Slowloris:** Configure `slowloris.pl` on the attacking machine with appropriate parameters.
  3. **Initiate Attack:** Start the Slowloris attack and monitor the target server's response.
  4. **Monitor Impact:** Observe the server’s connection behavior and performance using tools like Netstat and Wireshark.

### 3.3. Analysis
- **Data Collection:** Gather network traffic logs, server performance metrics, and connection status from the attack and target machines.
- **Results:**
  - **Traffic Analysis:** Evaluate the traffic patterns generated by Slowloris and their impact on the server.
  - **Server Impact:** Assess the server’s response, including connection exhaustion and service downtime.

### 3.4. Reporting
- **Findings:** Document the impact of the Slowloris attack on the Metasploitable environment, including performance degradation and connection issues.
- **Recommendations:** Provide recommendations for improving server resilience against Slowloris attacks, such as implementing connection timeouts and using WAFs.

## 4. Conclusion
The project illustrates the effectiveness of the Slowloris attack on web servers and its potential to cause denial of service with minimal bandwidth. Key insights include the need for proper server configuration and proactive security measures. Future research could explore advanced mitigation techniques and the effectiveness of various defense strategies.
