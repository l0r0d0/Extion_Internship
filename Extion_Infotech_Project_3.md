# Simulated DDoS Attack Using Slowloris and Traffic Analysis

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Objective
- To simulate a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using Slowloris in a controlled environment.
- To analyze the traffic generated by the attack and trace its source.
- To document the findings and provide recommendations for mitigating such attacks.

### 1.2 Scope
- The project will involve setting up a virtual network, performing the attack, capturing and analyzing traffic, and generating a detailed report.

### 1.3 Tools and Technologies
- Kali Linux
- Slowloris.pl
- Wireshark
- Tshark
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- VirtualBox/VMware

## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1 Network Configuration
- **Target Server**: A simple web server running Apache or Nginx.
- **Attackers**: Multiple virtual machines or Docker containers to simulate multiple attacking hosts.
- **Monitoring Server**: A separate VM with monitoring tools.

### 2.2 Tool Installation

#### Kali Linux
Ensure it is updated and has all necessary tools installed.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install perl git wireshark tshark
```

#### Slowloris
Download Slowloris from its official repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gkbrk/slowloris.git
cd slowloris
```
Ensure perl is installed:
```
sudo apt install perl
```
#### Monitoring Tools
Install and configure the ELK stack on the monitoring server.

#### 3. Attack Configuration
##### 3.1 Launch the Attack
Run the Slowloris attack from multiple attacking hosts.
```
perl slowloris.pl -dns <target_ip> -port 80 -timeout 30 -num 1000 -cache
```
Adjust parameters:

- dns <target_ip>: Target server IP or domain.
- port 80: Port to attack.
- timeout 30: Timeout value.
- num 1000: Number of connections to maintain.
- cache: Prevent caching.
##### 3.2 Capture Traffic
Start Tshark or Wireshark on the target server to capture incoming traffic during the attack.

###### Using Tshark
```
sudo tshark -i <interface> -w /path/to/output.pcap
```
#### 4. Traffic Analysis
##### 4.1 Timing Analysis
Open the captured traffic file in Wireshark.
Sort the packets by time to see the first and last packet timestamps.
Calculate the duration by subtracting the start time from the end time.
##### 4.2 Volume Analysis

Use Wireshark to filter the traffic specific to the attack (e.g., tcp.port == 80 for HTTP).
Check the statistics by going to Statistics -> Summary.
Note the number of packets and total data size.
##### 4.3 Pattern Analysis
Use Wiresharkâ€™s I/O Graph feature (Statistics -> I/O Graph) to visualize traffic over time.
Look for consistent patterns or intervals that match the attack's behavior.
Adjust the graph settings to highlight bursts or anomalies.
##### 4.4 Source Tracing

In Wireshark, apply a display filter to show only packets related to the attack (e.g., tcp.flags.syn == 1 for SYN packets).
Go to Statistics -> Endpoints and look at the IPv4 tab to see a list of source IP addresses.
Use Kibana to import and visualize the log data:
Create an index pattern for your data in Kibana.
Use the Discover tab to search for specific source IP addresses.
Create visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs) to show the distribution of attack sources.
