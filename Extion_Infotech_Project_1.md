## List of Sources, Tools, and Regulatory Guidelines

### Detailed References:

1. **SWEET32 Attack**: CVE-2016-2183 - Vulnerability in 3DES cipher suites.
   - **Description**: The SWEET32 attack targets 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard) cipher suites, exploiting vulnerabilities related to collision attacks due to the small block size of 64 bits in 3DES. This vulnerability can be exploited over time to decrypt encrypted traffic.
   - **Source**: [CVE-2016-2183](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183)
   - **Impact**: If exploited, attackers could intercept and decrypt sensitive data transmitted over networks encrypted using 3DES, potentially compromising confidentiality.

2. **TLS 1.0 Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2015-2808 - Issues with TLS 1.0 protocol.
   - **Description**: CVE-2015-2808 highlights vulnerabilities in the TLS 1.0 protocol, including weaknesses in cipher suites and potential for downgrade attacks. TLS 1.0 is considered insecure due to its susceptibility to cryptographic vulnerabilities.
   - **Source**: [CVE-2015-2808](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808)
   - **Impact**: Exploitation could lead to interception of sensitive information transmitted over insecure TLS 1.0 connections, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.

3. **nginx Information Disclosure**: CVE-2019-20372 - Vulnerability in nginx web server.
   - **Description**: CVE-2019-20372 refers to an information disclosure vulnerability in nginx web server versions prior to 1.17.7. This vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information from nginx server responses, potentially exposing server configurations or user data.
